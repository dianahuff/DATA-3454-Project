## Aspects of a story
Story elements :
1. character
2. problem
3. guide
4. plan
5. call to action
6. stakes


## Necessary Aspects :

1. Your “Big Idea”


2. A description of your audience, and the problem


3. A description of your data source, and why you’re convinced it will work for this project. You’ll need to create at least 3~5 significant visualizations in the final project.


4. A storyboard


5. Some proposed ideas for possible visuals that will help you tell your story in the final project (don’t actually create any visuals at this stage - sketches or mock-ups are good)


6. Your thoughts on how you’ve applied storytelling elements and visualization principles to this presentation, and how you plan to apply them in the final presentation.
